# Maintenance Interval Prediction Model From E-coating Ultrafiltration Maintenance Dataset.
* Design a predictive model to determine the maintenance interval based on an industry case study from an electrophoresis painting plant where deployed an IIoT system.
* Linear Regression, XGB, Random Forest, Ridge, and Lasso Regressor are applied to choose the best prediction model.
